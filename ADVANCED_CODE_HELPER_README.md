## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run advanced_code_helper.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Example Use Cases

#### 1. Ask Bioinformatics Questions
```
Question: "How do I calculate GC content in a DNA sequence using Python?"
```

#### 2. Explain Code
```
Code Snippet:
def find_orfs(sequence, min_length=75):
    orfs = []
    for frame in range(3):
        # ... code ...
    return orfs
Question: "Explain this ORF finding function"
```

#### 3. Analyze Files
Upload a FASTA file and ask:
```
"Analyze this sequence and suggest potential genes of interest"
```

#### 4. Debug Code
```
Code Snippet: [Your Python/R code with an error]
```
